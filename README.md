- **NLP**: NLTK, Spacy, ruBERT, transformers
- Built and fine-tuned multi-class and binary classification models for text (toxic comments, tariff recommendations, CEFR level prediction), and image data (age estimation).
- Developed and deployed time series forecasting models for demand prediction (taxi orders, product trends).
- Extensive experience in both binary classification (churn prediction, cancellation prediction) and regression tasks (housing price prediction, car price prediction).

**Big Data & Distributed Systems:**
- Pyspark, Spark for large-scale data processing and model building, including projects like California Housing Price Prediction.

**Tools & Technologies:**
- Git, Yandex DataLens, SAS, SQLAlchemy, Joblib, MLflow
- Version control with Git, experience with model tracking and experiment management using MLflow, and automation of workflows.

**Project Experience:**
- **Financial Models**: Building, validating, and fine-tuning financial models for banking risk analysis, pricing, reserve calculation, and bankruptcy prediction.
- **NLP Systems**: Designed and implemented NLP-based classification systems using ruBERT and transformers for sentiment analysis, toxic comment detection, and text-to-image search.
- **Demand Forecasting**: Developed time series forecasting models for demand prediction (taxi orders, marketplace product trends), leveraging PyTorch and statsmodels.
- **Customer Analytics**: Led customer churn prediction projects in both telecom and banking sectors, applying data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model tuning to achieve high accuracy.
